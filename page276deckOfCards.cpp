  super important.. i put std::cout << deck[1]; outside the forloop because the forLoop doesnt have a return value
  if I put on line 19, deck[1]=-777 and run line 22, IT WILL SHOW THAT INDEX 1 IS -777
  I sum it up to say this.. even though int deck[NUMBER_OF_CARDS] = 52, after the forloop, or during, its making i count from 0 to 51
  then assigning each indexes to deck[NUMBER_OF_CARDS] or deck[52]..
  like saying "out of deck[NUMBER_OF_CARDS], deck[0] = 0, deck[1] = 1,deck[2] = 2...deck[51 = 51"
  so its still remembering deck[NUMBER_OF_CARDS] or deck[52], its just assigning each index with a number
  REMEMBER THIS!! REMEMBER IT FAREAL. Sometimes things dealing with arrays dont need a return value.
  the reason thy its important to remember say deck[NUMBER_OF_CARDS] is because you can actually get more specific with it
  in a forloop like deck[i] or deck[0]=777, and can cout<<deck[0] outside the forloop because you just identified something specific
  with deck[NUMBER_OF_CARDS]  woooow   YOU JUST DENOTED IT..  ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥SHAINAðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ SAID DENOTE IS TO MAKE A STATEMENT. YOU BASICALLY MADE A STATEMENT
  SO, WITH AN ARRAY, YOU CAN DENOTE IT INSIDE A FORLOOP
