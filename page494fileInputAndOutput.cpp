    // it just knows its a number. So double will still work

    // this part is to check if a specific file name is open

    // its a parameter when we are creating out own function and invoking the function, with a an arguement to the function we created
    // HERE, we are invoking a function, yes, but since we never made the open() function [cause its embedded in C++]
    // we're just calling it.
    // so basically, we are doing the part we do last if we were to make the actual function called open()
    // so, we are invoking open("scoreez.txt") and whoever the hell made the actuall function, makes it open the actual file, if there is one

    input.open("scoreez.txt");
